        <p>
            Thus can my <b>love</b> excuse the slow offence
            <br>
            Of my <b>dull</b> bearer when from thee I speed:
            <br>
            <sub>From where thou art why should I haste me thence?</sub>
            <br>
            
            Till I return, of posting is no need.
            <br>
            O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
            <br>
            When swift extremity can seem but slow?
            <br>
            Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
       
        </p>
